        <p>
          So, the prog. This whole idea of this project started when I realized that I don't want to build server side
          page. So, I decided to build angular page instead. But... Angular on it's own can handle with most of our labs
          and there will be no java. So... I needed something which was made on java. And that was the moment when I
          realized. I want to build service.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to all that I wanted that service to be built using spring boot and I wanted it to use database.
          My dad helped me pick the db - cockroachdb. A relation database built on Golang. Now I knew what I wanted, but
          building it...
        </p>
        <p>
          I started with the service. Without database, and no ideas about how spring works I entered spring
          initializer. A few guides there a bit of documentation here na here I am building Hello World. It was a
          success, I got my first response in postman. Yay. I continued and returned basic hardcoded arithmetic
          operation from 2 url params and the service calculated 1 + 2. I then added body to the request and sent the
          result not as an int but as an Object with int. Then... I Started building calculation algorithm
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea came to me from our Discrete Mathematics lab works(Tsymbal thank you very much). I needed to build a
          Tree, which will calculate itself and a way to build this tree. I wanted to store the tree itself in db but
          that's not fun, so I started building the polish translator. The idea was to build that tree from something
          like this "sqrt abs + a / b c" so... I split it by spaces and then iterate resulting array, if I have
          operation corresponding to that string - I add operation, if I can parse this string to double - I add
          constant and if parsing failed - i have param name and then i just add it. This whole thing started to work,
          and it was the time to move the db from in memory Collection to cockroach
        </p>
        <p>
          I just downloaded docker image of that db and started it. That was easy. I wasn't setting any security and
          clusters, so it was very simple. I then added a table and a simple row (id: 1, polish: "+ a b", parameters: "a
          b") and... Nothing works. I needed to customise connection to db. And i did just that. Url to it, username and
          password. And it started working.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it's time to make it the way it should be. I added the post and get mapping with url like formulas/id and
          getting from db by that url. After I restarted PC... Everything crashed. IDK why. Just... Spring couldn't
          connect to db it just took forever to access db. After a couple of frustrating hours I realized... i forgot to
          init database. After that it was working like a charm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the user side. Angular, typescript, material etc. I am not a pro in that stuff but i had some
          experience... but... anyway it looked wired af. I added routs, math component and this test docs component. I
          was just testing material and displays here. And... I had a lot of things going wrong... Forgot to import
          HttpClientModule and boom math component doesn't show. So... I simulated response from server and started
          designing form to enter params. With Spread I made form controls, made all params required, and with ngFor and
          ngIf I displayed cool form with params only if they were in response. I pretty much made everything and...
        </p>
        <p>
          BOSS BATTLE CORS POLICY. I fear no man... but that thing... it scares me... Cross origin xmlhttprequest are
          not allowed. So... It was the 3rd day of my constant work... and... It was getting pretty late when this
          started. I needed to customize my service, so it allows those connections. And... I opened tutorial on spring
          site, I was reading, then I tried and... Deprecated class. So... I can't use that tutorial. What about
          annotations on controller? Well... Now my get request would work. But I couldn't post. I tried almost
          everything. I added all the configs I could and it still didn't work. The OPTIONS request was getting 403
          status code. Something wasn't allowing that request. And... At 2AM I went to bed. Defeated. And today, when I
          am writing all this stuff. I found class to which that deprecated one was changed... F... So, I added that
          class, added proper methods and headers and boi oh boi. I GOT 5. 2 + 3 = 5 and my lil boi showed this to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final touches were: add this documentation cuz I had a lot of pain and I need a bit of pleasure from this
          project; remove some(a lot of) unused getters setters constructors in service and... I think that's all. If
          you are reading this - thank you for your attention. Have a nice day!

      <mat-tab label="The Explanation">
        <h2>The site</h2>
        <p>
          You are now viewing this documentation on single page application(I'll call it spa cuz it's where user gets
          most of pleasure... and cuz it's abbreviation). This page is built using angular and angular material with a
          little design advices from my gf, thank you very much. The angular allows me to build this spa. It is a
          complex project which is then built into one web site, which once loaded from server, will be fully working
          without internet(you won't get formulas from service though). The angular material makes this whole thing
          pretty with animations and stuff. The core concept of this site was to use the service, so using HttpClient I
          can send different requests on urls with bodies or not. And this is how I get formulas. This site sends get
          request to get array of available formulas. The ids are then put into menu and once you select formula, form
          with required params will popup. When you enter numbers and then press send, the spa sends post request with
          all those parameters you specified to the service. In response the result of calculations is send and
          displayed just below the button.
        </p>
        <h2>The service</h2>
        <p>
          This is core part of this project, it is the brain of this whole system. It is the RESTful web service built
          using spring boot which processes requests, makes connections to database, calculates formulas and much more
          stuff. Let's walk through a simple workload. The spa sends get all formulas request to the service, then it is
          passed to RestController's get mapping, b4 Controller can do anything the spring automatically injects the
          repository, which allows basic operations with database. It retrieves formulas from database and then sends
          the id and required parameters back to site. Next time site till attempt to calculate formula by sending post
          request with formula parameter names and values in payload. It is passed to Controller, which then executes
          post mapping. It gets formula by id from database. The formula is stored in polish way(+ a b). It is then
          translated to the formula tree, where in each node operation/constant/parameter name is present and if it's
          operation, the array of similar formulas. When compute method is executed. The tree recursively computes
          itself using map of request parameters(it places their value in right place) and then gives the answer. The
          answer is packed and then sent as a response. That's the most basic stuff. But it is enough to understand what
          is going on.
        </p>
        <h2>The Database</h2>
        <p>
          The service need a place to store data. Or just a place where it can find data. This is where database comes
          in hand. I am using Relation based database called CockroachDb(my dad suggested it). It's a neat db made on
          Golang. I am not using the relation based tables and all neat stuff it provides, but I am still using db.
          There is one table of formulas, where 1 formula is a row with unique id, polish formula representation and
          required parameters for this formula. There is not much to say about it, really. The next part, however, is
          interesting.
        </p>
        <h2>The Docker</h2>
        <p>
          The application need to run somewhere and I want it to setup it by running one command line command. But...
          Setup 3 things, connect them... it's too much. So, I am using docker for it. It allows me to build docker
          images, which I pre divine. Docker image is a set of instruction which docker runs to build the component.
          When you run docker build. The component installs all it needs, runs build in that environment and after the
          app is built, it deploys it without tools needed for building. This allows me to build apps using 1 command.
          Now, building all apps at once! It is done using docker-compose, the tool which allows you to build multiple
          services which will be all run together in docker. And that is what I am doing. When I run docker-compose
          first the db is run, setup and initialized, then the service starts, the env variables are set, spring boot is
          started and configured, and then the nginx is started(it is hosting the spa). Default http port is forwarded
          to nginx and port 8080 is forwarded to service. And... That's it! The app is running.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          So... Now you know what is happening behind the scenes. It's a bit ruff explanation but if you know all that
          stuff - you will understand what is happening, and if you don't know that stuff, you will understand a bit and
          don't get confused.
        </p>
